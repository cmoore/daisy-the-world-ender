* What is this?

An experiment in generating a game in Javascript from Common Lisp.


* Running

** You'll need

- node / npm
- a lisp with quicklisp installed.
It's tested with SBCL but there's really nothing SBCL specific in the code.

#+BEGIN_SRC

npm install
...
sbcl --load init.lisp

#+END_SRC

Then, connect to http://localhost:8080/ and see if it works.

=write-javascript= writes the code, and =compile-javascript= runs browserify on it making the =bundle.js= file.

The interesting parts are in =src/js.lisp=.
